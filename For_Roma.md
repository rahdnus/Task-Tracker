# FOR ROMA

“Today we have gathered to investigate the assassination of Emperor Caligula and his family cept Consul Claudia. The emperor was last seen being escorted by three men, their faces covered. We beseech you, the tribunals, to uncover the truth and bring the three to justice.”

The council is adjourned and the 6 gathered praetorians disperse. All except for two.The two men stood in silence waiting for the other to speak out.

“Pray tell me Cassius, who killed the Emperor?” says one.

“I would like to know that myself, Rubrius.” says the one named Cassius.

Neither needed to ask why one would kill Caligula. To put it charitably the Emperor was not the kindest soul in Rome. But to go as far as to murder his family portrayed a level of commitment.

“Whoever it was, the senate surely must be happy with this outcome. They wish to use this opportunity to abolish the empire. Aye, tis why they tasked us with the investigation while they prepare for the coming changes.”

“Alas, Consul Claudias hinders them yet from the road to a Republic Rome '' exclaims Cassius.”Unlike our bygone emperor, Claudias is a pious man. May great reforms follow his wake and may Rome stand tall once more.”

“Aye. We must ensure no tragedy befalls Consul Claudias. Whoever killed Caligula might strike again”

“Friend, they would not kill the Consul. He is but a poor old man who has done no evil. He is Rome’s hope .”

“Unfortunate as it is, The Senate will not give up this opportunity. With their greatest threat taken care of they will seize this moment.”

“You are accusing the Senate of plotting and assassinating the Emperor?”

“No.” says Rubrius. “Twas you that plotted the scheme. The Senate had no hand in this matter. It was you and your cohorts. Cassius could no longer take the abuse he constantly received from the Emperor. In a moment of frenzy he gathered his loyal cohorts and murdered the emperor. This is the truth of the matter and will be told as such to the public.”

Cassius stares in disbelief. He could not comprehend the words that had just been uttered. Nay. He understood every word that Rubrius had just spoken but the conclusion drawn from this string of words left Cassius flabbergasted.

“Cassius ,Friend, for your crimes against the empire the magistrate has deemed you guilty of regicide. As such you are to be executed. For Rome.”

# AFTERWORD

Originally Emperor Caligula was assassinated by Cassius and a few members of the senate,notably Marcius and Lucius. Shortly after the assassination Cassius was one of the assassins to be executed. Other involved parties got away with little to no repercussions which sounded a little fishy to me.
I took some creative liberty in retelling this event and decided to make Cassius completely innocent. By the end of this story he has been falsely accused by the Senate who are the actual perpetrators and as such is executed for his crimes. I wanted to depict a more cruel version of history where those in power control the narrative.
